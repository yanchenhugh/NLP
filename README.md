Selected Projects include:

Supervised Learning | Classification Analysis on Bank Customer Churn Data, Using Scikit-Learn:
* Apply the random-forest model w/ XGboost.
* Cross-validate the model using Grid Search on hyperparameter values, e.g., maximum depth, subsample ratio and method and learning rate.
* Evaluate the model performance using accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores.

RNN and CNN, Transfer Learning | Dog-Cat Image Classification, Using Pytorch & torchvision:
* Load and transform the RGB data of dog & cat images into batches.
* Transfer the pre-trained densnet121 and resnet50 model, but modify the final fully-connected layer to fit the binary classification task.

Unsupervised Learning | Clustering Analysis of Penguin Biological Data, Using Scikit-Learn:
* Compare the models of KMeans, DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering.
* Evaluate the model performance using Silhouette score. Identify KMeans as the best model.
